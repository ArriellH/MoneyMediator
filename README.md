For my project I will develop an expense tracker inspired by this Github expense tracker project called the [Professional Expense Tracker.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMLsR0_2yIE) 
This app will help you record your income and expenses using a database through sqlite3.
 This app will allow users to input data to view, track and anticipate present and future expenses.
If able I would like to add a way to incorporatate viewing credit usage and growth .
The goal of this app is to teach the user budgeting skills, make them more consious of spending habits, and help with maintaining healthy credit history.
